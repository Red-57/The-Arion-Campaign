	description "The Arion Roaster is the most powerful weapon that they have developed so far, it is a plasma based weapon that fires a kind of gel at high velocity and very long range, it is, however, very large and its power requirements are immense so you would need quite a large ship to wield it"
	description "One interesting thing about it is that the Korath Detainer was designed after it using the same superheated plasma, however their weapon was much less efficent and slowed down the enemy instead of heating it up."
