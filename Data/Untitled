**Describe the bug**
I downloaded endless sky from github using this link https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/download/v0.9.12/endless-sky-macos-0.9.12.dmg but when I opened the game it automatically crashed. this may be a problem with my operating system (Mac OS 10.15.6 Catalina). I also tried to compile the code from scource but when I opened it using xcode the program glitched and wouldn't load, xcode then told me that it couldn't find a pointer to the open routine.


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Download Mac OS 10.15.6 Catalina
2. Download Endless sky for mac (version 9.12)
3. open the game

alternativly
2. Compile endless sky from scource
3. Run in xcode


**Expected behavior**
in theory the game should not crash on opening and it should be able to load

**System:**
 - OS: Mac OS 10.15.6 Catalina
 - Game Source: Github or self compiled
 - Version: 9.12
