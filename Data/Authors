	description "This ship was first built millennia ago, near the end of a more violent time in Hai history. Since then, it has served as the only heavy warship at the disposal of the Hai. The Shield Beetle is a versatile warship used by the Hai to guard their merchant convoys, or by the Unfettered to attack those very same convoys."

		description "The Lionheart Raven is their most popular warship, an agile and elegant vessel that can nevertheless deal out and absorb considerable damage. Ravens are a favorite ship for bounty hunters, because they are more than a match for pirate interceptors and can be used by a skilled pilot to take down much larger ships as well."
