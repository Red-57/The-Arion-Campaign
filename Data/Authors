	description "This ship was first built millennia ago, near the end of a more violent time in Hai history. Since then, it has served as the only heavy warship at the disposal of the Hai. The Shield Beetle is a versatile warship used by the Hai to guard their merchant convoys, or by the Unfettered to attack those very same convoys."
